# New version of our Submittion

Based on the comments provided, we ran a number of extra experiments that further strengthened the claims made in our submission. The new version of our submission is uploaded as an anonymized PDF. We suggest readers to download it instead of reading it online, which will allow for a faster review.

Specifically, during the rebuttal we ran experiments with:

- The effectiveness verification of our method on four additional complex scenarios (sparse reward, image input) is added.
- The key and common problems in the review comments are analyzed in detail in the corresponding sections.
- Fix the figure and text issues.
- Ablation analysis regarding growth/pruning rate, initial sparsity, replay ratio and growth pattern is added.
- Further verify the gain of ER on the overall algorithm on complex scenes
- More contrasts of relevant baselines are added.
